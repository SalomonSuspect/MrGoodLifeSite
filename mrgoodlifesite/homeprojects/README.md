## Adding A Task
**Cadence**: This field is for tasks which will be reoccurring. This is in the timedelta format. To enter on the admin page the format is: 

`DD HH:MM:SS`

For example a timedelta of 22 days, 3 hours, 44 minutes and 1 second would be 22 03:44:01
## MVP
 * Ability to list all tasks by priority and or due date (HTML, email, local python)
 * Ability to reactivate task at specified Cadence
 * Ability to mark task as complete - journal entry
 * Basic CI to validate
